# ML-Project-Guide
This document is dedicated to centralizing, organizing and documenting ideas that particularly stuck with me - from various amazing books, online courses and tutorials, some of which are:

* *Becoming a Data Head* by Gutman/Goldmeier
* *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* by Aurelien Géron
* *Einführung in Data Science* by Grus (O'Reilly)

**This guide will be continously updated.**
