# ML-Project-Guide
My personal guide on how to approach ML projects, a compilation of questions to ask, steps to take, factors to consider - derived from personal experience, amazing books and online courses and tutorials, some of which are:

* *Becoming a Data Head* by Gutman/Goldmeier
* *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* by Aurelien Géron
* *Einführung in Data Science by Grus (O'Reilly)
